With this top of mind, Portfolio Strategy and Delivery’s (PSD) purpose is to translate Roche strategies into PD priorities and deliver PD’s portfolio with excellence. As an End-to-End Business Team Coach , you will act as a strategic partner to high-priority teams (including LCTs, GDTs, GFTs, etc.) across the R&D value chain. You will be responsible for building and executing a systemic coaching strategy that enables the delivery of PD’s core business and critical priority projects. You will contribute to the overall success of PD Growth & Performance (G&P) by improving team effectiveness, equipping teams to navigate complexity and accelerate decision-making, problem-solving, and delivery. The Opportunity Systemic Team Coaching: Deliver end-to-end coaching interventions for high-priority assets (with TA-Focus), LCTs, GDTs, GFTs, STs and other prioritized teams at critical junctures (start-ups, milestones, transitions, etc.). You will look beyond individual personalities to the broader system, aligning stakeholders and ensuring cross-functional accountability. Strategic Business Impact: You will focus on directionally improving key business value drivers by coaching teams toward excellence in problem-solving and execution. You will move beyond traditional dynamics to ensure that team efforts are measured by their success in delivery and their alignment with PD’s core priorities. Foster Systemic Team Health & Alignment: In partnership with Resourcing Leads (RLs) and Global Program Managers (GPMs), you will accelerate team effectiveness through clarity and alignment. Being aware of the particularities of each TA, you will be accountable for ensuring that the health of the team system acts as a high-performance engine for the drug development lifecycle. Operationalize the TA-Model: Deepen your business understanding of specific Therapeutic Areas (TAs) to provide targeted value and impact, ensuring coaching triggers are aligned with the new LSPC prioritization framework. Data & Performance Culture: Maintain a systems-thinking perspective and use data/metrics to identify cross-organization insights. You will be accountable for demonstrating the measurable impact of coaching interventions. Innovation & AI Integration: Stay ahead of industry trends to enhance team performance and proactively explore and visualize the use of AI, automation, and digital technologies to enhance team performance and coaching efficiency. Standards of Practice and Value Measurement: Contribute to and adopt Standards of Practice and Value Measurement & Reporting, ensuring consistent quality and a clear link between coaching interventions and business impact across the global organization. Who you are Education: Bachelor’s degree required; Master’s/MBA preferred. Formal accreditation in Team Coaching (ICF, EMCC, or equivalent) is essential. Experience: Significant experience in Pharma/Biotech or high-complexity industries. Proven track record of systemic team coaching for global, matrixed teams through large-scale change and drug development lifecycles. Experience must go beyond individual (1:1) coaching to include end-to-end work with cross-functional teams. Systemic Mindset: Deep understanding of systemic frameworks (e.g. Leadership Circle, etc.). You view team effectiveness as a function of People Dynamics, Systemic Dynamics, and (crucially) Achieving Results. Business Acumen: Strong end-to-end awareness of the R&D value chain. You understand the \"business of science\" and the value drivers that matter to Clinical Operations, Regulatory, and Commercial teams as well as the complex dynamic of bringing people from those functions into effective development and lifecycle teams. Data & Technology: You are comfortable using data to diagnose team health and measure the success of your interventions. You have a vision and experience for how Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged for team coaching. Agile Skillset: While not an \"Agile Coach\" by title, you possess agile facilitation skills and can apply them pragmatically to solve business bottlenecks. Coaching Presence: You possess exceptional ability to create safe spaces while remaining a \"container\" for teams to navigate high-stakes competing business situations. You have excellent facilitation skills and the ability to influence in environments of ambiguity. Roche is an equal opportunity employer.
