Position Overview The Associate Director of International Therapy Development – Reducer, is a senior leader responsible for shaping and scaling the Reducer therapy across France and the UK—two high-priority markets currently operating without reimbursement and relying on registry participation and trial-related pathways to treat eligible patients. The role focuses on strengthening referral networks, elevating clinical and patient-flow maturity across centers, and preparing both markets for a smooth transition to full reimbursement once landmark trial data are published. This involves building national strategies, ensuring consistent and high-quality execution by the existing Therapy Development team, and creating scalable, repeatable frameworks that support sustainable therapy adoption. The position is highly cross-functional and works closely with Sales, Marketing, Training &amp; Education, and Medical Affairs to ensure integrated planning and alignment across all activities related to therapy development and physician engagement. Essential Job Functions Lead, coach, and elevate an established team of Therapy Development Managers across France and the UK, ensuring consistency of field execution, high engagement quality, and clear alignment with national and international priorities. Provide strategic guidance, prioritization, and course correction to ensure focus on the highest-value activities in non-reimbursed markets. Map national and regional referral pathways, identify bottlenecks, and create actionable plans to expand patient identification and referral volume. Strengthen collaboration between general and interventional cardiologists and drive broader disease-state awareness across both countries. Build structured relationships with clinical societies and networks to elevate the therapy’s visibility and credibility. Ensure strong performance within registries and trial-related pathways, supporting optimal patient selection and consistent therapy flow. Collaborate with clinical stakeholders to improve adherence to protocols, enhance funnel quality, and reinforce center engagement. Prepare France and the UK for the future shift to reimbursement, focusing on stakeholder readiness, scalable pathways, and evidence-based positioning. Partner closely with Marketing, Training &amp; Education, and Medical Affairs to align on educational needs, clinical engagement models, and external communication strategies. Provide structured field insights to inform strategic planning, resource allocation, and cross-functional program design. Drive the export of learnings from France and the UK to other markets, while ensuring that best practices developed elsewhere are integrated locally where relevant. Translate high-performing approaches from other geographies into tailored strategies for both countries and maintain strong alignment with the international therapy-development ecosystem. Own key performance indicators for referral activity, center maturity, and funnel progression, using data to guide strategy, improve execution quality, and refine TDM focus. Convert field insights into scalable and repeatable solutions that can be deployed across markets. Requirements Minimum 8&#43; years of leadership experience in clinical, market development, therapy awareness, marketing, product management, sales, or medical education within the MedTech industry. Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in both the French and UK healthcare environments, with a solid understanding of their clinical ecosystems, decision pathways, and access dynamics. Proven international experience, across multiple European geographies, with the ability to translate best practices across diverse healthcare systems. Strong preference for cardiovascular or interventional cardiology background. Demonstrated experience in referral-based market development, including the ability to identify, engage, and activate indirect users (general cardiologists, non-implanting clinicians, referring physicians) who influence but do not perform the procedure. Successful track record building trust-based relationships with key opinion leaders and broader clinical networks. Experience working with clinical trial data to build compelling, evidence-based value propositions. Prior people-leadership experience with field teams, ideally in therapy development or adjacent roles. Fluent in English and French, with strong communication and stakeholder-management skills. Thrives in ambiguous, fast-moving environments and is motivated by building new frameworks rather than inheriting mature ones. Willingness to travel across France, the UK, and other international markets as needed. Required Skills: Preferred Skills:",

Visionaries like you work on teams that save lives by developing the medicines of tomorrow. Join us in developing treatments, finding cures, and pioneering the path from lab to life while championing patients every step of the way. Learn more at https://www.jnj.com/innovative-medicine . We are searching for the best talent for on Computational Characterization of Protein Structures using MD and AI/ML with HDX-MS Intern to be in Spring House, PA. The Intern term is from June to August, 2026. Full time requirement (40 hours per week). Purpose: Accurate prediction of protein and protein complex structures is essential throughout structure-based drug discovery. Recent AI/ML advances significantly improved prediction accuracy and efficiency, particularly diffusion-based co-folding methods like AlphaFold3, Boltz-2, Chai-2, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, and OpenFold-3, now enable reliable in silico predictions of experimentally validated structures and key binding sites for diverse biomolecular complexes including protein-small molecule, protein-PROTAC/molecular glue ternary complexes, protein-peptide, protein-nucleic acid, and antibody-antigen complexes. These tools generate both static structures and conformational ensembles, facilitating integration with molecular dynamics simulations to capture system dynamics in understanding the mechanism of action (MOA). Despite their promising utility, these predictions still require experimental confirmation (e.g., X-ray or Cryo-EM), which often relegates their application to retrospective studies and limits their impact in early-phase drug discovery. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is increasingly used to study protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions by measuring the exchange rate of backbone amide hydrogens with deuterium, reflecting flexibility and solvent exposure. HDX-MS offers insights into protein structure and dynamics, complementing high-resolution X-ray data. It is easier and earlier to use than X-ray or Cryo-EM in early drug discovery. Recently, HDX-MS has seen broader application in physics-based simulations, and AI/ML models now reconstruct HDX data and help prioritize protein structure models by matching experimental results to structures. Co-folding models and HDX-MS are widely used at Johnson &amp; Johnson, driving both large and small molecule modalities. Multiple co-folding platforms have been established, and extensive HDX-MS spectra for various protein targets, along with physics-based computational analysis tools, have been developed. By further integrating AI/ML capabilities and evaluating physics- and ML-based HDX methods for prioritizing co-folding models, structure-based design can be improved before X-ray or Cryo-EM data are available. This approach will accelerate our drug discovery cycle and enhances collaboration with internal and external partners. The main objective of this project aims to integrate public HDX modeling methods with internal physics-based approaches in the JNJ platform to improve selection of correct bound complex structures, reweight MOA-related conformational ensembles, and identify potential cryptic pockets for allosteric protein-ligand binding. The student will create benchmark datasets of co-folding models, develop Python scripts to automate both public and internal HDX-MS modeling methods, and evaluate them through prioritizing co-folding models in modality-agnostic targets, especially focus on antibodies and antigens. The student is expected to work in a team environment, having direct interaction and good communication with people from different departments within JJIM. The student will gain experience with physics- and AI/ML-based methods, understand HDX-MS data, and learn how it informs protein structure selection. The enhanced platform will streamline co-folding model prioritization and increase effective use of co-folding models and HDX-MS data in drug discovery projects at JJIM. You will be responsible Develop Python scripts to automate the integration of public methods into the JNJ computational platform. Perform scientific computations, such as co-folding and molecular dynamics, to generate protein structure models within a Linux environment. Carry out statistical and AI/ML data analyses, and evaluate existing HDX modeling approaches for prioritizing structural candidates. Qualifications / Requirements: Completion of Undergraduate Freshman year at an accredited University is required. Applicants must be currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate students pursuing a bachelor’s, master’s, PharmD, or PhD degree at an accredited college or university in Computer Science, or related fields. Continuous enrollment is required throughout the entire internship period. Have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher, which is reflective of all college coursework. Fluent in written and spoken English, great interpersonal, verbal and written communication and presentation skills Self-motivated, passionate about structure-based drug discovery and computational programming in linux and windows system Enthusiastic, collaborative, able to build relationships and work within global matrixed and cross-functional teams A foundational knowledge of protein and protein complex structures is essential, along with proficiency in scripting using Python, Shell, and GitHub and PyTorch framework. Experience with HDX-MS, molecular dynamics and AI/ML data analysis is considered advantageous. Keywords: AI/ML, co-folding, molecular dynamics, HDX-MS, Protein Structure, X-ray structure, Cryo-EM structure, structure-based drug design, protein structure, conformational ensemble, protein dynamics. Permanently authorized to work in the U.S., must not require sponsorship of an employment visa (e.g., H-1B or green card) at the time of application or in the future. Students currently on CPT, OPT, or STEM OPT usually requires future sponsorship for long term employment and do not meet the requirements for this program unless eligible for an alternative long-term status that does not require company sponsorship.
